			<p class="lead">Meet Steve and Manny, the dynamic duo whose friendship and shared passion for design and craftsmanship blossomed into the thriving Artisan Kitchen and Bath. Their journey began in a modest workshop in Cornwall, where their dreams and hard work laid the foundation of what would become a beacon of quality and innovation in kitchen and bath design. Starting in their 20s with ambition and a hands-on approach, theyâ€™ve grown their business with a personal touch, overseeing every project to ensure it meets their exacting standards. Now, with a talented team of eight employees and a portfolio brimming with continuous, high-quality builds, Steve and Manny remain at the heart of the operation, infusing each space with their relentless energy and creative vision. Their story is one of friendship, dedication, and a commitment to creating spaces that are not just functional, but truly the centerpieces of their clients' homes.</p>
