			<p class="mb-3">Artisan Kitchen and Bath were called in to renovate an old condo from the 60's - new kitchen plan complete with cabinets and many "nice to have" updates. Steve took the same approach in updating the bathrooms with fresh new cabinets and ideas to maximize space while creating the new look.</p>
			<p class="mb-3">He prepared a good plan, presented fresh ideas, finalized a reasonable quote based on known lead times, and executed the plan perfectly. The kitchen arrived on time and the install went very good, especially given the challenges of hanging cabinets on old plaster walls without the usual studs to anchor them to.</p>
			<p class="mb-3">I felt that this contractor was very talented, he communicated well and in a timely fashion, and was very co-operative in providing ideas and information outside his kitchen/bath obligations. And at end of each day, his house keeping was such that there was never any reason to follow behind and re-do the clean up - he was fussy about his work and paid close attention to detail throughout.</p>
			<p class="mb-3">There is no doubt that I would contact Steve through Artisan Kitchen and Bath to help me out with the next project.</p>

			<p class="mb-3">We met with multiple contractors for our kitchen renovation, and then along came Artisan. To say we are happy with our new kitchen would be an understatement. Artisan truly brought my vision to life!</p>
			<p class="mb-3">They are extremely professional, have excellent communication skills, meticulous and organized. They are always willing to trouble shoot and be flexible. We've already had them back for some additional work, and wouldn't hesitate to hire them again! Thanks again Artisan!!</p>
