                        <h4>Transitional</h4>
                        <p>Offering the best of both worlds, transitional kitchens include elements of both traditional and contemporary design equating to a classic look. Eclectic in nature, they mix natural and man-made materials as well as finishes and textures. Subtle accents draw the eye, adding flair without going overboard.</p>
